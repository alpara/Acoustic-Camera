# Acoustic-Camera
A Matlab implementation of an Delay-Sum Acoustic Camera Beamformer

## Description

The Delay and Sum beamfomer implememnted with Matlab uses a virtual Projection Plane in front of the camera. The Sample Data uses a 3 second white noise signal recorded with an 128 cannel microphone array. The Dimension and Distance of the Virtual Projection Plane can be adjusted in the constances section of the matlab script.
